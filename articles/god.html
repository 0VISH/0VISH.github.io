            People usually visualize a small round ball when they hear the word particle. These small balls then come together and form bulk material.

Waves, on the other hand, don't makeup anything. They are disturbances on these continuously connected balls.
Well, not really. The waves which I described are called "mechanical waves". They require balls. "Non-mechanical waves" like light, don't need balls. These waves are just another form of energy.

Energy can exist as a particle as well as a wave. Hence, atoms, light, etc... all behave as particles as well as waves. Bulk material, like your ball, also behaves as a wave. We don't observe the wave nature of bulk materials because their wavelengths are too small to be observed.

When a particle shows wave and particle nature, we face a few difficulties while measuring properties such as its position, momentum, etc... Heisenberg, in 1927, showed that we can never know the exact position and momentum of a particle at the same time. There is always some error in the measurement/uncertainty in our knowledge.

∆x∆p >= ħ

The only way to know the future of any system is to know the position and momentum of all the particles in the system. A simple system can be modeled by math, but in a complex system, where chaos comes into play which math cannot take into account, the only way to know its future is by knowing these two parameters for all the atoms present in the system. When you set the system to the entire universe, you become an All-knowing being. Heisenberg is not happy.
