            The universe holds many secrets. If you want to understand the universe, one of the best ways I know is to forget about it and pick up something completely unrelated and pursue it. Try to understand it inside out. This will lead you to the heart of the universe. The only proof I hold to support this theory is that I have noticed many fields that seem completely unrelated, happen to support a common set of beliefs such as: simplicity, divide and conquer, etc...

            Programming happens to be a field that is inexpensive(after buying the computer that is) as compared to something like electronics or rocketry. You can learn engineering through programming almost free of cost, whereas the latter fields are an expensive way to learn the same. Both tell you something about the universe, but programming lets you listen for a lower price than electronics or rocketry.

            It takes effort to transfer/map this knowledge to other fields. It is a muscle that can be trained. Hence, I believe we should be a master of a trade, and try to map our learning to other trades. This would then let us connect dots from one field to another, giving us a big picture. Maybe then we would know a thing or two about this mess we are in.
