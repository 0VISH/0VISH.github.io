            Don't sign contracts. Try your best not to. People around you will try to convince you that you need the contract or else you won't win. They may be correct, but keep in mind
            1) They signed the contract and they are getting others to also sign it as a way to justify their action.
            2) Maybe when they signed it, the contract made sense. If you think the contract doesn't make sense now, don't sign the contract.
            Don't be average anon. Be free.
