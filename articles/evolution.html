            Humans are very inefficient. We waste up to 6-8 hours every day sleeping. We have social needs. We spend a lot of time raising our offspring. These are all the limitations of being a carbon-based creature. It takes a long time to rewire our genes. Our tribal part of our brain hasn't yet caught up and many businesses try to exploit this fact.

            Once we combine the robotics field with the deep learning field, I believe that will be the next step in evolution. There won't be any more Darwinian evolution: slow, carbon-based. Evolution will take less time and be more silicon-based.
            Then we go extinct. Sounds very dystopian, but the only reason we are ruling Earth is because we are the smartest species currently. If we make robots stronger than us, and smarter than us, they will be the superior species. They will rule over Earth and have no need for us.
